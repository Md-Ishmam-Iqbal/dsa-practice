## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Each algorithm is accompanied by its own test suite written using Jest to ensure correctness and functionality. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about algorithms or an experienced developer brushing up on your skills, I hope repository can help you in your problem solving endeavors.

## Algorithms

Here is a list of algorithms currently included in the repository:

- **Semantic Versioning**: Find the highest version in an array of semantic version strings.
- _(Add more algorithms here)_

Each algorithm is contained in its own JavaScript file within the `algorithms` directory.

## Test Files

For each algorithm, there is a corresponding test file written in Jest with the naming convention `algorithm_name.test.js`. The test files ensure that each algorithm functions correctly under various scenarios and edge cases.

## Local Development Setup

To set up this repository for local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/algorithms.git
   ```
2. Go to the directory
   ```
   cd algorithms
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run test if you want
   ```
   npm test
   ```
